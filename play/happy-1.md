# If you're happy

If you're happy and you know it, overthink. 

If you're happy and you know it, overthink. 

If you're happy and you know it, 

Give your brain a chance to blow it. 

If you're happy and you know it, overthink!

--- 

I feel charming
Oh so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel
And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real
